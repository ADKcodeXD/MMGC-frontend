  "MDesc": "Mirai MAD Team was founded on March 17th, 2012, and has a history of more than 8 years so far. There are currently 100 members in the team, including MADers who specialize in stills and PVs such as Tabibito, Shinya, Hakurei Suika, Kuroiwa, Kappu, Yiyuan, Dazao, and Miya Kiyone. There are also members who are good at AMV production, such as Binxue, Xiaoyangxiaer, Diamond Xinghen, and Dikaer. The team leader is Yuuki Noin.",
  "MDesc2": "Mirai is derived from the Japanese romaji for the word 'future'. The name Mirai mainly has two meanings: one is to cultivate future MAD gods, which means that newcomers with zero skills now can become very powerful technical gods in the future; the other is to explore new MAD production modes in the future, including various blends of animation AMV, stills, PVs, MMD, etc.",
  "MDesc3": "The aim of Mirai MAD Team is to let more people know about MAD and to encourage more people to participate in MAD production. Therefore, if you love MAD and want to make MAD, welcome to join the warm family of Mirai MAD Team!",
